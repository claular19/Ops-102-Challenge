# Ops-201-Challenge

This repo is a culmination of all my coding challenges completed while in my Code Fellows Ops 201 course. 

As I begin my journey into the tech workforce, learning these coding fundamentals are incredibly valuable for a wide array of specific jobs. Learning directly how to navigate and
utilize the Linux terminal and Windows Powershell allows me to gain a basic understanding of its functionality, that I can continue to build and grow off of.

Throughout these coding challenges I learned loads of commands and how they function. From the start, I learned how to set a variable and incorporate functions into my script.
Building off of core scripting principles like that, I ended up creating scripts that could ask a user for an input, display diagnostics, and load data from commands into files
for viewing.

Personally, my favorite coding challenges were the ones that had the least issues. Running your script and see it successfully accomplish what I wanted it to was unbelievably 
satisfying. 

I think part of the goal with scripting is to automate tasks as efficiently as possible. Having these examples of scripting under my belt will allow me to contribute to creating
efficient scripts for the workplace.

I'd personally go back and work more on the scripts that required a menu for the user to enter information into. Creating a more intuitive menu design sounds like it would be 
interesting to learn how to do.

Continuing from now on, I'd like to improve on my ability to add variables and functions to my scripts for more efficiency. I believe this skill would be useful for future jobs
that require a hefty amount of coding.
